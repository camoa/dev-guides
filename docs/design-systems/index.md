# Design Systems

Guides for the design-to-code pipeline: analyze a design system, map it to Bootstrap, implement in Radix/SDC.

| I need to... | Guide |
|-------------|-------|
| Identify design tokens, components, patterns from any source | [Recognition](recognition/index.md) |
| Map design system patterns to Bootstrap 5.3 | [Bootstrap Mapping](bootstrap/index.md) |
| Implement in Drupal with Radix theme and SDC components | [Radix SDC Mapping](radix-sdc/index.md) |

## Workflow

```
1. Recognition → Analyze design (Figma, HTML, screenshots)
2. Bootstrap → Map tokens to variables, components to Bootstrap
3. Radix SDC → Build Drupal sub-theme with SDC components
```
