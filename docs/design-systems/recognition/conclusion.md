## Conclusion

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for AI to analyze and decompose design systems from any source, with opinionated best practices based on 2025-2026 industry research. The key principles:

1. **Start with tokens, not components** — Foundation layer reveals whether you're analyzing a true system or just a component library
2. **Look for inconsistencies** — 5 different grays = no system; design debt reveals governance failures
3. **Follow atomic hierarchy flexibly** — Use labels as communication aid, not dogma; avoid rigid taxonomy wars
4. **Check responsive behavior** — A system that only works at one breakpoint isn't a system
5. **Dark mode as litmus test** — If token values can't swap, architecture is wrong
6. **Assess governance maturity** — Changelog, contribution process, deprecation policy separate maintained systems from abandoned ones
7. **Validate against standards** — W3C DTCG, WCAG 2.2, atomic design methodology (2025 evolved version)
8. **Use source-specific strategies** — HTML/CSS, Figma, and screenshots each require different recognition approaches

**Remember:** This is a recognition AND quality assessment framework. The goal is to map what you observe to a structured design system hierarchy while evaluating whether it's a GOOD design system or one accumulating design debt.
