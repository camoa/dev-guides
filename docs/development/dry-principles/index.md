# DRY and Code Reuse Principles

Tool-agnostic, language-agnostic development principles for understanding DRY, code reuse, and abstraction strategies.

## I need to...

| Identify code duplication in my project | [Code Duplication](code-duplication.md) |
| Ensure single source of truth for business rules | [Knowledge Duplication](knowledge-duplication.md) |
| Learn abstraction strategies | [Abstraction Strategies](abstraction-strategies.md) |
| Know when it's safe to abstract | [Rule of Three](rule-of-three.md) |
| Apply DRY to configuration | [DRY in Configuration](dry-in-configuration.md) |
| Apply DRY to documentation | [DRY in Documentation](dry-in-documentation.md) |
| Apply DRY to tests | [DRY in Testing](dry-in-testing.md) |
| Apply DRY across system boundaries | [DRY Across Boundaries](dry-across-boundaries.md) |
| Avoid over-abstraction | [Over-DRY Anti-Patterns](over-dry-anti-patterns.md) |
