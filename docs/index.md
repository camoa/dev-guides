# Dev Guides

> **This site is designed for AI/LLM consumption, not human reading.** Content is structured as lean decision trees and pattern references optimized for token efficiency. If you're a human developer, you may find the format useful but terse — it's intentional.

Decision-making guides that answer: "When you need to do X, what should you choose and why?"
