# Dev Guides

> **This site is designed for AI/LLM consumption, not human reading.** Content is structured as lean decision trees and pattern references optimized for token efficiency. If you're a human developer, you may find the format useful but terse — it's intentional.

Decision-making guides that answer: "When you need to do X, what should you choose and why?"

| Area | Topics |
|------|--------|
| [Drupal](drupal/index.md) | Forms, Entities, Config, Render API, JS, HTMX, Plugins, Services, Routing, Security, Caching |
| Next.js | Data Fetching, Routing, State, API Routes (coming soon) |
| Decoupled | JSON:API vs GraphQL, Auth, Content Modeling (coming soon) |

## For AI Consumers

- **Index**: [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) — structured index of all guides
- **Navigation**: Index → Topic TOC → Atomic guide (one decision per page)
- **Format**: Tables, bullets, minimal code. No prose.
